  --run               Name of run directory in <primarydir>
  --run_suffix        Suffix to add to run name to create new output run directory 
  --run_out           Output run directory name. If running casava begin and both run_suffix and run
                      are specified, run_out = <run><run_suffix>
  --lsubset           When running casava begin, a comma-separated list of lanes to process.
                      Default is all lanes.
  --tiles             When running casava begin, a comma-separated list of regular expressions used to select tiles.
                      If this parameter is specified, lsubset must specify a single lane for processing.
  --mismatches        Number of mismatches to allow in index when demultiplexing. Default is 0
  --store             1 to store records in database; 0 otherwise. Default is 1
  --filter            1 to turn on RTA chastity filter; 0 otherwise. Default is 1
  --fastqc            1 to turn on FastQC; 0 otherwise. Default is 1
  --fastqc_force      1 to turn on FastQC even when number of samples is large; 0 otherwise. Default is 0
  --ignore_nobcl      1 to ignore missing bcl files; 0 otherwise. Default is 0
  --ignore_nocontrol  1 to ignore missing control files; 0 otherwise. Default is 0
  --md5sum            1 to create md5sum checksums; 0 otherwise. Default is 1
  --clean             1 to clear log and output directories before processing; 0 otherwise. Default is 1
  --merge             1 to merge sample fastq data across lanes; 0 otherwise. Default is 0
  --quiet             1 to suppress output to STDOUT; 0 otherwise. Default is 0
  --nthreads          Number of threads for casava processing. Default is 16
  --primarydir        Directory containing Illumina runs. Must contain run directory specified with -run option.
                      Default is /n/illumina01/primary_data
  --progressdir       Directory for intermediate results. Default is /n/seqcfs/sequencing/analysis_in_progress
  --finisheddir       Directory for finished results. Default is /n/seqcfs/sequencing/analysis_finished
  --finaldir          Directory to which finished results are copied. Default is /n/ngsdata
  --casdirlist        File containing the names of the lane folders to process. By default this file is
                      created by casava begin and its default name is <logdir>/folders.txt. Use -lsubset
                      instead of -casdirlist if running casava begin.
  --logdir            Log directory where code, copy of checksums and any job errors are written.
                      The default logdir is $CASLOGROOT/<run_out>. $CASLOGROOT is specified in casava.config.
                      If logdir already exists and clean == 0, a new logdir is created within the existing one.
  --msamplist         Optional file containing names of samples to merge across lanes after postprocessing 
                      and fastqc. One sample name per line. Names must match this run's SampleSheet.csv. The 
                      default is to do the merge for all samples in the lane folders listed in <casdirlist>.
